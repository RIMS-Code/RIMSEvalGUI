# RIMSEvalGUI v2.0.12

ToDo: update `rimseval version`

RIMSEvalGUI release based on the latest `rimseval` development version `v2.0.x`.

**Main Changes to GUI:**
- Integrals can now be saved to a `csv` file from the menu and with keyboard shortcuts. This is mostly in preparation for the full data evaluator.

Changes in `rimseval` package since last version: see [here](https://github.com/RIMS-Code/RIMSEval/releases/tag/v2.0.x).
