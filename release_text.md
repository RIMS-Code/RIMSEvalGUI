# RIMSEvalGUI v2.0.10

RIMSEvalGUI release based on the latest `rimseval` development version `v2.0.0.dev7`.

**Main Changes to GUI:**
- Calibration file reading error should now display a more useful error message, instead of just a `json` read error.
- The row headers for each integral now contains a filled circle in the same color as the peak itself is colored in when looking at the plot.

Changes in `rimseval` package since last version: see [here](https://github.com/RIMS-Code/RIMSEval/releases/tag/v2.0.0.dev7).
