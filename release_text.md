# RIMSEvalGUI v2.0.12

RIMSEvalGUI release based on the latest `rimseval` development version `v2.0.1`.

**Main Changes to GUI:**
- Overlap between integrals and peaks is now automatically checked for and corrected.
- Backgrounds are automatically sorted when created or edited.
- Clean file button was added under "Special". This cleans up calibration files and saves them, mostly for files that were originally generated on older versions of the software and for which sorting of integrals, backgrounds, etc. was never done properly.

In addition, the new release contains several bugfixes, see commit log for details.

Changes in `rimseval` package since last version: see [here](https://github.com/RIMS-Code/RIMSEval/releases/tag/v2.0.1).
