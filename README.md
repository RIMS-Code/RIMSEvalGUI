# RIMSEvalGUI

This is the development branch for the GUI.
It uses [`fbs`](https://build-system.fman.io) for packaging
and you need an `fbs pro` license in order to package and use it.
All requirements are then handled by `fbs`.
If you want to manually install the requirements,
please check out the [`rimseval` repo](https://github.com/RIMS-Code/RIMSEval).
This project uses `PyQt6`.
